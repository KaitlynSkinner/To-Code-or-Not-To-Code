## Features



## Technology Used
* **Git:** Version control system to track changes to source code.

* **GitHub:** Hosts repository that can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

* **Node.js:** Used for package managment and to execute JavaScript code to build the command line tool for server-side scripting.

* **Express.js:** Express. js is a Node. js web application server framework, designed for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. Used in this application to set middle ware for end point connection between the front end and backend.

* **Mongoose:** is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.

* **MongDB:** is a general purpose, document-based, distributed NoSQL database built for web application developers in the cloud era. It’s one of the most popular database choices for modern applications.

* **MongoDB Atlas:** is a cloud-based database service that's created and maintained by MongoDB. It works with hosting services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help users provision, maintain, and secure new databases for their applications.

* **GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with your existing data, giving clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more. (For this application, graphql package is used to parse GraphQL syntax in both front-end and back-end codebase.)

* **Apollo Server** is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client, the client is used in the MERN application. (For this application, the apollo-server-express package is used to integrate GraphQL into the Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from React front end to the GraphQL API.)

* **React Router** is a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application, allowing you to make single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications. (For this application, the react-router-dom npm package is used to work with React Router.)

* **The concurrently npm package** allows you to run multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface. Rather than opening multiple terminals to start the multiple servers, you can run them both at the same time. It also allows you to keep track of different outputs in one place, and will stop all of your processes if even one of them fails.

* **JSON Web Tokens** or JWTs, are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication.

* **jwt-decode** is an npm package that helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. (For this application, it is used to extract non-sensitive data such as the token’s expiration date to see if it’s expired before making a request to the server.)

* **The faker npm package** allows you to generate massive amounts of fake data in the development environment of your Node.js applications.

* **The nodemon package** simplifies the development environment by automatically restarting the Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
